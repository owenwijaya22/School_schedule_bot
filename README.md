# School Schedule Bot
A "helper bot" to remind me of my university schedules

The bot will send  gmail embedded with the course infos such as the course name, building name, and the time it starts and ends.
It will also open the zoom app if there's any zoom class available.
You have two options to use the program, the oop way or the parsing json way.
Pick whatever suits your needs the best.




P.S.: motivation for creating this project? I keep forgetting my schedules all the time...
