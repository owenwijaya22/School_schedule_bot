# School Schedule Bot

The bot will send  gmail embedded with the course infos such as the course name, building name, and the time it starts and ends.<br />
It will also open the zoom app if there's any zoom class available.<br />
You have two options to use the program, the oop way or the parsing json way.<br />
Pick whatever suits your needs the best.




P.S.: motivation for creating this project? I keep forgetting my schedules all the time...
